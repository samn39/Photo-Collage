# Photo-Collage
A program to convert input images into a collage of photos using the concept of a 2D array.
In this program, you will implement some useful algorithms for graphs that represent friendships (e.g. Facebook). A friendship graph is an undirected graph without any weights on the edges. It is a simple graph because there are no self loops (a self loop is an edge from a vertex to itself), or multiple edges (a multiple edge means more than edge between a pair of vertices).

The vertices in the graphs for this assignment represent two kinds of people: students and non-students. Each vertex will store the name of the person. If the person is a student, the name of the school will also be stored.

Hereâ€™s a sample friendship graph:

(sam,rutgers)---(jane,rutgers)-----(bob,rutgers)   (sergei,rutgers)
                          |                 |             |
                          |                 |             |
                     (kaitlin,rutgers)   (samir)----(aparna,rutgers)
                          |                            |
                          |                            |
  (ming,penn state)----(nick,penn state)----(ricardo,penn state)
                          |
                          |
                     (heather,penn state)
